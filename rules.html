<h2>1 Timeout each half, 1 Floating Timeout</h2>
<p>
Start of game is a disc flip. Winner of the flip chooses side or possession. Teams swap after halftime.
</p>
<p>When Soft cap horn blows, play until the end of the point. If there is no winner (at the original point target, win by 2 no longer applies), add 2 to the higher teamâ€™s score. Play until that new score is reached. If the new score is above 13, play until 13. Win by 2 no longer apples.
</p>
<p>
At hard cap, finish point currently in progress (if one team is on the line with 7 players, the point has started and will be played before determining the winner). If one team has more points, they win. If the teams are tied, play 1 more point to determine the winner.
</p>
<p>
In the spirit of Cognex and Ultimate, All players should be given time to be allowed to play. Captains should be sure that all players have a chance to play.
</p>
Truly dangerous plays results in Ejection from tournament on second violation.
<p>
Makeup day is Friday but hopefully not needed.
